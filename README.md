# IB-Pseudocode-Interpreter

## Description:
  This project is intended to provide beginners with a tool to learn
pseudocode. I found it difficult to get accustomed to the convention before
and I want to ease the future user's experience. It includes a line-by-line 
debugging feature with a trace table so students can find errors in their code
easier.

## Running:
  Run the [Interpreter.java](./interpreter/Interpreter.java) class.  
## Todo:
- Refactor
- Implement array operations
